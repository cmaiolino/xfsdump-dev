xfsdump-2.2.7 (13 March 2003)
	- add initial support for TS tape driver.
	  (19 February 2003)
	- fix xfsdump -I option to set correct fsid

xfsdump-2.2.6 (19 December 2002)
	- add initial internationalisation support.

xfsdump-2.2.5 (19 December 2002)
	- fix build fallout from macro changes in XFS headers.
	- add a configure check so that we don't attempt to build
	  against old versions of the headers.

xfsdump-2.2.4 (08 November 2002)
	- configure now looks for, and xfsinvutil uses, the ncurses
	  header and library rather than the curses version - this
	  resolves an issue in those distributions that don't make
	  the compatibility library available.

xfsdump-2.2.3 (31 October 2002)
	- minor update to Debian packaging dependencies.
	- inventory related bugfix.

xfsdump-2.2.2 (03 October 2002)
	- Remove fork/setuid from fsr.  Just chown temp. file to owner.
	  This gets fsr working again with the restricted RESVSP ioctl.
	  Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>

xfsdump-2.2.1 (24 September 2002)
	- minor troff-version-specific fixups for xfsrestore(8).

xfsdump-2.2.0 (03 September 2002)
	- force use of version 1 XFS geometry ioctl everywhere in xfsdump
	  package, so that these tools can still work on older kernels
	  (they don't need the additional information in the new ioctl).
	- added new config.h.in and configure changes to implement this.
	- do some additional cleanup after autoconf has run.

xfsdump-2.1.5 (14 August 2002)
	- minor build fix when using relatively old versions of glibc
	  which don't provide the SYS_getdents64 symbol.

xfsdump-2.1.4 (01 August 2002)
	- xfsinvutil -m option added (merge from IRIX).
	- add missing GPL/copyright headers to several xfsinvutil files.
	- correct several uses of uuid_compare in xfsinvutil.

xfsdump-2.1.3 (30 July 2002)
	- small xfsinvutil fixups to preserve compatibility with old -n
	  option.
	- fixed all new xfsinvutil warnings on 64bit platforms

xfsdump-2.1.2 (29 July 2002)
	- xfsinvutil interactive mode
	- merge of a dump/restore fix from IRIX - test if a child exited
	  with error and if a child did, set the exit_code to EXIT_ERROR.

xfsdump-2.1.1 (04 July 2002)
	- build infrastructure updates so that configure options can be
	  used to specify paths rather than semi-hard-coded path names
	  controlled by the ROOT/ROOT_PREFIX environment variables; eg.
	  now allows /lib64 and /lib32

xfsdump-2.1.0 (14 June 2002)
	- new fsinfo system call used, mostly changing version to
	  differentiate this.

xfsdump-2.0.4 (14 June 2002)
	- fix xfsrestore/xfsdump version output to report both 
	  their version and the respective dump format version. They
	  will report their version from cmd/xfsdump/VERSION.  
	- changed the messages printed out for the xfsrestore 
	  interactive mode to emphasize the restore is interactive.
  
xfsdump-2.0.3 (08 May 2002)
	- fix xfsdump so that it does not cause segmentation fault
	  when media specific object id (OPT_MOBJID) is specified 
	  with -I option.
	- fix similar code for filesystem id (OPT_FSID) option. 

xfsdump-2.0.2 (08 May 2002)
	- in xfsdump, check for ERANGE as well as E2BIG for testing
	  of the existence of the SGI_XFSDUMP_SKIP_FILE extended
	  attribute. This only affects dumping using the -e option. 
	  This was motivated by an XFS kernel change from returning
	  E2BIG into returning ERANGE.
	- fix "xfsdump -v silent" to really be silent

xfsdump-2.0.1 (13 April 2002)
	- minor build system updates

xfsdump-2.0.0 (07 February 2002)
	- rework all code dealing with extended attributes to use
	  the new system calls (requires attr-2.0.0 or greater)
	- also, the attrctl-by-handle ioctl is history, replaced
	  by libhandle routines - more like what we have in IRIX
	  (requires xfsprogs-2.0.0 or greater)
	- effectively no-op change (cleanup) - switch over to using
	  XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY instead of XFS_IOC_GETFSUUID ioctl, so
	  we can deprecate that "special" UUID ioctl in the kernel.
	- add -q description to xfsdump/xfsrestore man pages and
	  usage text.
	- change failed bulkstat WARNING to a TRACE message to that
	  it doesn't bother people.
	- avoid a possible assertion failure for cumulative restores
	  with -B option.

xfsdump-1.1.14 (16 January 2002)
	- fix xfsrestore so that cumulative restores (with -r)
	  will successfully delete removed directories whose
	  files have also been removed.
	  Previously, the files weren't removed until later, 
	  which meant that early directory removal failed.
	  SGI bug#844219.

xfsdump-1.1.13 (11 January 2002)
	- fix xfsdump so that if an inode# is reused in the time
	  between building the inode map and pruning the inode map
	  (in phase 3 when some dirs are marked as not changed),
	  that it no longer aborts with an assertion failure.
	  SGI bug#846374.

xfsdump-1.1.12 (14 December 2001)
	- add new -B option to xfsrestore to correctly assign
	  ownership and permissions of the dump root directory
	  to the destination directory

xfsdump-1.1.11 (13 December 2001)
	- port back IRIX changes primarily to xfsrestore for
	  improving performance when one has over a million files
	- some extra mlogs (messages) for dump estimates, 
	  dir tree diagnostics, type of dump format being used
	- various fixes for restore with multiple threads
	  and extended attributes (note: multiple threads not
	  implemented on Linux yet)

xfsdump-1.1.10 (10 December 2001)
	- fix xfsdump to endian convert all of the record header
	  fields properly just prior to writing the header out
	  (in particular first_mark_offset).
	  This caused do_next_mark() assertion failures at some
	  sites.

xfsdump-1.1.9 (28 November 2001)
	- fix xfsrestore so that it doesn't delete hardlinks
	  on alternate cumulative restores

xfsdump-1.1.8 (14 November 2001)
	- allow xfsdump to exclude files based on whether they have
	  a certain extended attribute set
	- don't include /var/lib/xfsdump in the dump

xfsdump-1.1.7 (18 October 2001)
	- xfsrestore -t will no longer fail if the current working
	  directory is not xfs
	- xfsrestore will no longer issue (harmless) warnings related
	  to space pre-allocation if it is writing to a non-xfs
	  filesystem

xfsdump-1.1.6 (03 October 2001)
	- get rid of useless stkchk abstraction
	  (will no longer get stack info messages with -v proc=debug)
	- FHS compliance for inventory directory (/var/lib/xfsdump),
	  and existing installations will continue to work as is.
	- A future xfsdump release will have an updated xfsinvutil to
	  allow the old directory to be migrated to the new manually,
	  without corrupting the inventory (its one or the other only
	  though, not both, and this is enforced by the tools)

xfsdump-1.1.5 (28 September 2001)
	- changes for ia64 (e.g. time32_t, getdents, librmt mtget changes)
	- fix dump/restore to be able to use drive_scsitape with devfs

xfsdump-1.1.4 (18 September 2001)
	- fix librmt to allow a remote path without "/dev" in its name
	- this allows xfsdump/xfsrestore to remote file
	- fix librmt for remote uname to use env variable RSH  
	- add some diagnostics to xfsdump

xfsdump-1.1.3 (27 July 2001)
	- fixes for (hopefully) the last few nits in libtool usage

xfsdump-1.1.2 (24 July 2001)
	- merge in phase 3 changes from review and further testing
	- merge in code to specify maximum file size for xfsdump (-z)
	- merge in code to specify media file size for xfsdump (-d)
	- merge in code to request single media file for xfsdump (-S)
	- merge a couple of minor bug fixes from IRIX

xfsdump-1.1.1 (23 July 2001)
	- look for libtool archives in /usr/lib, not /lib

xfsdump-1.1.0 (18 July 2001)
	- rework package to use libtool
	- merge fsr bug fixes from IRIX
	- merge xfsdump phase 3 performance fixup from IRIX
	- enable use of (shared) libhandle.so and libattr.so
	- re-enable use of libdm.so for DMAPI support
	- remove some more unused "common" files
	- man page updates for xfsdump and xfsrestore
	- moved certain binaries from /usr/sbin into /sbin to
	  be available for recovery when only root is mounted

xfsdump-1.0.12 (13 July 2001)
	- Fix mistake introduced in 1.0.10 whereby xfsdump/xfsrestore 
          to remote tape drives will cause rmt debug messages to be
          written to the remote machine in:
	      /server.XXX (where XXX = pid). 
	  These files will no longer be created via xfsdump/xfsrestore.
          The fix is in librmt - it should have only written out 
          warning messages and not debug messages.
          If the debug environment variable is turned on for librmt then
          the debug file will go to /tmp/librmt_debug.XXX.

xfsdump-1.0.11 (12 July 2001)
	- correctly restore block and character device major numbers

xfsdump-1.0.10 (05 July 2001)
	- produce librmt warning messages from xfsdump/xfsrestore
          without needing to set an environment variable 

xfsdump-1.0.9 (15 May 2001)
	- correctly [xfs]restore the suid and guid mode bits
 
xfsdump-1.0.8 (12 May 2001)
	- added build dependency for Debian on latest devel package

xfsdump-1.0.7 (07 May 2001)
	- fix warnings, remove last -Wall filter
	- configure script default man path now /usr/share/man
	- support realtime files in dump/restore
	- cleanup arch-specific code, esp. the byteswab routines
	- as a result, move to -O1 as default for extern inlines
	- fix bug dumping to remote tape device with given user

xfsdump-1.0.6 (01 May 2001)
	- remove spurious warnings when dumping quota information

xfsdump-1.0.5 (09 April 2001)
	- fix use of an uninitialised variable in dump
	- fix a number of compiler warnings

xfsdump-1.0.4 (03 April 2001)

        - minor rpm and deb packaging work

xfsdump-1.0.0 (15 January 2001)
	- dump, restore, fsr and co. abstracted from xfs-cmds package
        - completed Debian packaging
        - late beta code
