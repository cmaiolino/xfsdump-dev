xfsdump-1.0.12 (13 July 2001)
	- Fix mistake introduced in 1.0.10 whereby xfsdump/xfsrestore 
          to remote tape drives will cause rmt debug messages to be
          written to the remote machine in:
	      /server.XXX (where XXX = pid). 
	  These files will no longer be created via xfsdump/xfsrestore.
          The fix is in librmt - it should have only written out 
          warning messages and not debug messages.
          If the debug environment variable is turned on for librmt then
          the debug file will go to /tmp/librmt_debug.XXX.
