Description: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.
